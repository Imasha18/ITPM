Assignment 1
Install requirements (beginner mode) (STEP 2.1).

We will do ONLY this part now:
 Install Node.js
 Check node and npm

Nothing else yet.

 WHAT IS NODE.JS? (Very short, no theory)

Playwright depends on node.js.

The Node.js is also installed with npm through which Playwright is installed.

Assessment of Node.js - assignment cannot be done in the case of their absence.

 STEP 1: Determine whether node.js is installed or not.
1[?] Open Command Prompt (Windows)

Do this slowly:

Press Windows key

Type cmd

Press Enter

A black window opens. This is known as Command Prompt.

2[?] Type this and press Enter:
node -v

What you might see:
 Case A (GOOD)
v18.19.0


or

v20.x.x


 Node.js is already installed
 Go to STEP 3

 Case B (NOT INSTALLED)
node is not referred to as either a command or external or internal command.


 Node.js is NOT installed
 Continue to STEP 2

STEP 2: NODE.JS (LTS Version) INSTALL.
1[?] Open this website:

 https://nodejs.org

2[?] You will see TWO buttons:

 LTS (Recommended) - CLICK THIS

 Current

[?][?] DO NOT choose "Current"
Always choose LTS

3[?] Download & Install

Click LTS

Download .msi file

Double-click it

Click:

Next - Next - Next

 Keep ALL default settings

Finish

[?] Do NOT uncheck anything.

STEP 3: Examine NODE and NPM (Very important)
1[?] Close Command Prompt
2[?] Reopen (once again: Windows - cmd)

Now type one by one:

node -v


Press Enter
Then type:

npm -v


Press Enter

 Correct output example:
v18.19.0
9.6.7


 Node.js installed
 npm installed
 You are READY for Playwright

 COMMON PROBLEMS & FIXES
 Error: Problem: node not recognized.

 Restart your computer
 Open cmd again
 Try node -v

 Problem: Version highly outdated (v10, v12)

 Uninstall old Node.js
 Install latest LTS

 STOP HERE (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT go to Playwright yet.

 First, confirm this step.

 Next thing to do (and do not ignore).

reply to one of the following, specifically:

Success! node version is 3.0.0, node installed successfully.
OR

"I see some error" (and paste the error)

On this being ascertained, I will conduct you to:

 STEP 2.3: Develop Playwright project (with nothing to start).
(I do not have any phobia in code, I will demonstrate you all clicks and orders)
